## âœ… Task 1: P2P Transaction Fee System - COMPLETED

### Implementation Summary
Created a comprehensive fee management system that admins can control from the dashboard.

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`components/admin/P2PFeeSettings.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Fee settings component with enable/disable toggle
   - Adjustable fee percentage (0-10%)
   - Minimum fee cap (USD)
   - Maximum fee cap (USD)
   - Live fee preview for $100, $1000, $10000 transactions
   - localStorage persistence
   - Export functions: `getP2PFeeSettings()`, `calculateP2PFee(amount)`

2. **`app/admin/settings/page.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Integrated P2PFeeSettings component
   - Added to existing settings page alongside announcements

3. **`components/p2p/OrderModal.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Imported fee calculation utilities
   - Added fee state and calculation
   - Display transaction fee in blue info box
   - Show fee breakdown: percentage, amount, total

### Features:
- âœ… **Admin Dashboard Control**: `/admin/settings`
- âœ… **Enable/Disable Toggle**: Turn fees on/off instantly
- âœ… **Adjustable Percentage**: 0-10% range
- âœ… **Min/Max Caps**: Prevent too low or too high fees
- âœ… **Live Preview**: See fee impact on sample transactions
- âœ… **Order Modal Integration**: Users see fee before confirming
- âœ… **Fee Breakdown**: Clear display of fee percentage and total amount

### How It Works:
1. Admin goes to `/admin/settings`
2. Configures P2P fee settings (e.g., 0.5%, min $1, max $100)
3. Saves settings â†’ Stored in localStorage
4. When user creates P2P order:
   - OrderModal calculates fee using `calculateP2PFee(amount)`
   - Displays fee in blue info box
   - Shows total amount including fee
5. Fee is transparent to users before order confirmation

### Example Fee Calculation:
```typescript
// Settings: 0.5% fee, min $1, max $100
Transaction: $500 â†’ Fee: $2.50 (0.5%)
Transaction: $100 â†’ Fee: $1.00 (minimum applied)
Transaction: $50000 â†’ Fee: $100.00 (maximum capped)
```

### Testing:
1. Go to `/admin/settings`
2. Configure fee settings
3. Go to `/dashboard/p2p`
4. Click Buy/Sell on any ad
5. Enter amount â†’ See fee calculated automatically
6. Fee shows in blue box with breakdown
