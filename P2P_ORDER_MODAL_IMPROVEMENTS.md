## Security Considerations

### Data Storage:
- Account details stored in localStorage (P2POrder object)
- No encryption (mock data - not production-ready)
- **TODO for production**: 
  - Encrypt sensitive data
  - Store on backend only
  - Never expose full account details to all users
  - Mask partially (e.g., show last 4 digits only)

### Validation:
- Client-side validation only
- **TODO for production**:
  - Validate wallet address format (checksums)
  - Verify bank account format per country
  - Prevent injection attacks
  - Rate limiting on order creation

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Validation**:
   - Validate crypto wallet address format
   - Check wallet address is valid for selected crypto
   - Verify bank account number format (country-specific)

2. **Saved Accounts**:
   - Remember user's wallet addresses
   - Save multiple bank accounts
   - Quick select from dropdown

3. **QR Code**:
   - Generate QR code for wallet address
   - Allow camera scan for wallet input

4. **Copy Button**:
   - One-click copy account details
   - Toast confirmation on copy

5. **Payment Proof**:
   - Upload receipt/screenshot
   - Attach to order for verification
