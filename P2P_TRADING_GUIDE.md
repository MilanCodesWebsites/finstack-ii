## State Management

### localStorage Keys

  - Includes all order state and timestamps
  - Updated on every action (mark paid, release, cancel, rate)

### Mock Data Files
- `lib/p2p-mock-data.ts`:
  - Trader profiles
  - P2P ads
  - Type definitions
  - Helper functions

## Data Flow

```
1. User browses ads → Clicks Buy/Sell
2. Order Modal opens → User enters amount & confirms
3. Order created & saved to localStorage
4. Redirect to Order Detail page
5. Countdown starts (15 mins default)
6. Buyer marks payment → Status: awaiting_release
7. Seller releases crypto → Status: completed
8. Rating Modal opens → User rates trade
9. Rating saved → Order complete
10. View in Order History anytime
```

## Toast Notifications

Implemented for:
- Order created
- Payment marked
- Crypto released

- Insufficient availability

## Countdown Timer Logic
