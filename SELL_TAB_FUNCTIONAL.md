# P2P Sell Tab - Now Fully Functional

## What Was Fixed

### Issue:
The Sell tab had limited ads showing because there were only 2 "buy" type ads in the mock data.

### Solution:
Added 5 more merchant "buy" ads (where merchants are **buying crypto**, so users can **sell to them**).

---

## How P2P Ad Types Work

### Understanding Ad Types:
- **`type: 'sell'`** â†’ Merchant is **selling** crypto â†’ Users **BUY** from them
- **`type: 'buy'`** â†’ Merchant is **buying** crypto â†’ Users **SELL** to them

### Tab Display Logic:
```tsx
// Buy Tab - Shows merchants selling (type: 'sell')
const buyAds = filterAds(mockP2PAds, 'sell'); 

// Sell Tab - Shows merchants buying (type: 'buy')  
const sellAds = filterAds(mockP2PAds, 'buy');
```

This is **correct** - the logic was never broken, just needed more data!

- **5 "sell" ads** â†’ Show in Buy tab (users buy crypto)
- **5 "buy" ads** â†’ Show in Sell tab (users sell crypto)
